  Provides high-level functions for reading, writing, and modifying
  files and directories on all attached storage devices.

  This module requests information on the attached storage devices from
  the `storage` module (whose implementation is platform-specific) and
  reads the devices' MBR or GPT parition tables to determine filesystems.
  Then, the appropriate file system module is used to conduct file operations.

  The following directory structure is formed by this module:
    - All files and subdirectories of the "boot" storage device can be found
      under the root directory "/"
    - All files and subdirectories of additional storage devices (USB drives,
      populated floppy disk or CD drives) can be found under the path "/disk/",
      "/disk1/", "/disk2/", etc.

  Note that the paths the Lua environment interacts with are slightly different.
  See the lualib_fs module for how the paths are translated.
