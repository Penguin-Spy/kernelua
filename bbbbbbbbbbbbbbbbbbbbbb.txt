undefined instruction or data abort

undefined instruction:
  THEORY #1: libuspi is being built with compiler flags that cause it to use certain processor instructions that are not valid (and need to be enabled)
    solution: look at uspi's example env( & that other usage of it)'s startup code to see what exactly it does/enables
              also does it use VFP instructions?
              also check literally everything the startup code does to make sure we do everything necessary
  THEORY #2: our IRQ handling code is causing jumps to arbitrary memory, causing garbage to be executed, obviously leading to undefined instructions
              may also be causing the data aborts (when the garbage code is technically valid but does invalid stuff)
                we should be displaying whatever address we're jumping to b4 calling the handler (& also which IRQ caused it)
                so this ideally isnt the problem
                however, i haven't checked, so i shouldn't rule it out

data abort:
  THEORY #1: bug/uh oh in libuspi code (potentially with memory allocation/structs)
    solution: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  THEORY #2: bug in our IRQ handling
    solution: find it and SMAK
